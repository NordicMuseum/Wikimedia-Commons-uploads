## About this repo
This repo contains the python3 scripts used by the Nordic Museum to upload images
to Wikimedia Commons. It is based on [lokal-profil/upload-batches](https://github.com/lokal-profil/upload-batches).

To run it you will have to install [`BatchUploadTools`](https://github.com/lokal-profil/BatchUploadTools)
and [`pywikibot`](https://github.com/wikimedia/pywikibot-core) using:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

*Note*: You might have to add the `--process-dependency-links` flag to the above
command if you are running a different version of pywikibot from the required one.

This is a work in progress during the fall of 2017. For more details, contact
[Aron Ambrosiani](https://github.com/Ambrosiani).
