## About this repo
This repo contains the python scripts used by the Nordic Museum to upload images to Wikimedia Commons. It is based on
[lokal-profil/BatchUploadTools](https://github.com/lokal-profil/BatchUploadTools) and [lokal-profil/upload-batches](https://github.com/lokal-profil/upload-batches).

To run it you will have to install `BatchUploadTools` using:
`pip install git+https://github.com/lokal-profil/BatchUploadTools.git`

*Note*: You might have to add the `--process-dependency-links` flag to the above
command if you are running a different version of pywikibot from the required one.

This is a work in progress during the fall of 2017. For more details, contact [Aron Ambrosiani](https://github.com/Ambrosiani).
